# Navigation-master
A library providing basic functionalities for the navigation of a four wheeled robot.

## How to use?

A detailed explaination of using the library as well as creating your own library for arduino is given on my blog. Please check out: https://tripsbro.blogspot.in/2017/08/how-to-write-your-own-library-in-arduino_99.html

## Quick Use:

**1.**

Copy both the source and header files in a folder, place it in library folder of your Arduino and name it Move . Note that if the folder name is different from the class name, of the header file, then the Arduino won't recognise it as a library.

**2. **

Upload Navigation-master.ino
